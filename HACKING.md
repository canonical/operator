# Setting up a Dev Environment

To work in the framework itself you will need Python >= 3.8. Linting, testing,
and docs automation is performed using
[`tox`](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which you should install.
For improved performance on the tests, ensure that you have PyYAML
installed with the correct extensions:

```sh
apt-get install libyaml-dev
pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir pyyaml
```

# Testing

The following are likely to be useful during development:

```sh
# Run linting and unit tests
tox

# Run tests, specifying whole suite or specific files
tox -e unit
tox -e unit test/test_charm.py

# Format the code using Ruff
tox -e fmt

# Compile the requirements.txt file for docs
tox -e docs-deps

# Generate a local copy of the Sphinx docs in docs/_build
tox -e docs

# run only tests matching a certain pattern
tox -e unit -- -k <pattern>
```

For more in depth debugging, you can enter any of `tox`'s created virtualenvs
provided they have been run at least once and do fun things - e.g. run
`pytest` directly:

```sh
# Enter the linting virtualenv
source .tox/lint/bin/activate

...

# Enter the unit testing virtualenv and run tests
source .tox/unit/bin/activate
pytest
...

```

## Pebble Tests

The framework has some tests that interact with a real/live Pebble server.  To
run these tests, you must have [pebble](https://github.com/canonical/pebble)
installed and available in your path.  If you have the Go toolchain installed,
you can run `go install github.com/canonical/pebble/cmd/pebble@master`.  This will
install pebble to `$GOBIN` if it is set or `$HOME/go/bin` otherwise.  Add
`$GOBIN` to your path (e.g. `export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN` or `export
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin` in your `.bashrc`) and you are ready to run the real
Pebble tests:

```sh
tox -e pebble
```

To do this even more manually, you could start the Pebble server yourself:

```sh
export PEBBLE=$HOME/pebble
export RUN_REAL_PEBBLE_TESTS=1
pebble run --create-dirs --http=:4000 &>pebble.log &

# Then
tox -e unit -- test/test_real_pebble.py
# or
source .tox/unit/bin/activate
pytest -v test/test_real_pebble.py
```

## Using an `ops` branch in a charm

When making changes to `ops`, you'll commonly want to try those changes out in
a charm.

### From a Git branch

If your changes are in a Git branch, you can simply replace your `ops` version
in `requirements.txt` (or `pyproject.toml`) with a reference to the branch, like:

```
#ops ~= 2.9
git+https://github.com/{your-username}/operator@{your-branch-name}
```

`git` is not normally available when `charmcraft` is packing the charm, so you'll
need to also tell `charmcraft` that it's required for the build, by adding
something like this to your `charmcraft.yaml`:

```yaml
parts:
  charm:
    build-packages:
      - git
```

### From local code

If your changes are only on your local device, you can inject your local `ops`
into the charm after it has packed, and before you deploy it, by unzipping the
`.charm` file and replacing the `ops` folder in the virtualenv. This small
script will handle that for you:

```shell-script
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ "$#" -lt 2 ]
then
	echo "Inject local copy of Python Operator Framework source into charm"
	echo
    echo "usage: inject-ops.sh file.charm /path/to/ops/dir" >&2
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$2/framework.py" ]; then
    echo "$2/framework.py not found; arg 2 should be path to 'ops' directory"
    exit 1
fi

set -ex

mkdir inject-ops-tmp
unzip -q $1 -d inject-ops-tmp
rm -rf inject-ops-tmp/venv/ops
cp -r $2 inject-ops-tmp/venv/ops
cd inject-ops-tmp
zip -q -r ../inject-ops-new.charm .
cd ..
rm -rf inject-ops-tmp
rm $1
mv inject-ops-new.charm $1
```

### Using a Juju branch

If your `ops` change relies on a change in a Juju branch, you'll need to deploy
your charm to a controller using that version of Juju. For example, with microk8s:

1. [Build Juju and its dependencies](https://github.com/juju/juju/blob/3.4/CONTRIBUTING.md#build-juju-and-its-dependencies)
2. Run `make microk8s-operator-update`
3. Run `GOBIN=/path/to/your/juju/_build/linux_amd64/bin:$GOBIN /path/to/your/juju bootstrap`
4. Add a model and deploy your charm as normal

### Regression testing against existing charms

We rely on automation to [update charm pins](.github/actions/update-charm-pins/) of
a bunch of charms that use the operator framework. The script can be run locally too.

# Contributing

Changes are proposed as [pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/operator/pulls).

For coding style, we follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as well as a team [Python style guide](./STYLE.md). Please be complete with docstrings and keep them informative for _users_,
as the [ops library reference](https://ops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html)
is automatically generated from Python docstrings.

For more advice about contributing documentation, see [Contributing documentation](#contributing-documentation).

Pull requests should have a short title that follows the
[conventional commit style](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) using one of these types:

* chore
* ci
* docs
* feat
* fix
* perf
* refactor
* revert
* test

At present, we only add a scope in these cases:

* If the PR is limited to changes in ops/_private/harness.py, also include the scope `(harness)`
* If the PR is limited to changes in testing/, also include the scope `(testing)`

For example:

* feat: add the ability to observe change-updated events
* fix!: correct the type hinting for config data
* docs(harness): clarify the types of exceptions that Harness.add_user_secret may raise
* ci(testing): adjust the workflow that publishes ops-scenario

Note that the commit messages to the PR's branch do not need to follow the
conventional commit format, as these will be squashed into a single commit to `main`
using the PR title as the commit message.

## Copyright

The format for copyright notices is documented in the [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt).
New files should begin with a copyright line with the current year (e.g. Copyright 2024 Canonical Ltd.) and include the full boilerplate (see APPENDIX of [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)).
The copyright information in existing files does not need to be updated when those files are modified -- only the initial creation year is required.

# Contributing documentation

The published docs at [ops.readthedocs.io](https://ops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
are built automatically from [the top-level `docs` directory](./docs). We use [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/)
for most pages and arrange the pages according to [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/).

To contribute docs:

1. Fork this repo and edit the relevant source files:
   * Tutorials - [`/docs/tutorial`](./docs/tutorial)
   * How-to guides - [`/docs/howto`](./docs/howto)
   * Reference - Automatically generated from Python docstrings
   * Explanation - [`/docs/explanation`](./docs/explanation)
2. [Build the documentation locally](#how-to-build-the-documentation-locally),
   to check that everything looks right
3. [Propose your changes using a pull request](#contributing)

When you create the pull request, GitHub automatically builds a preview of the docs.
To find the preview, look for the "docs/readthedocs.org:ops" check near the bottom of
the pull request page, then click **Details**. You can use the preview to double check
that everything looks right.

## How to write great documentation

- Use short sentences, ideally with one or two clauses.
- Use headings to split the doc into sections. Make sure that the purpose of each section is clear from its heading.
- Avoid a long introduction. Assume that the reader is only going to scan the first paragraph and the headings.
- Avoid background context unless it's essential for the reader to understand.

Recommended tone:
- Use a casual tone, but avoid idioms. Common contractions such as "it's" and "doesn't" are great.
- Use "we" to include the reader in what you're explaining.
- Avoid passive descriptions. If you expect the reader to do something, give a direct instruction.

## How to build the documentation locally

To build the docs and open them in your browser:

```sh
tox -e docs
open docs/_build/html/index.html
```

Alternatively, to serve the docs locally and automatically refresh them whenever you edit a file:

```sh
tox -e docs-live
```

## How to document version dependencies

We don't publish separate documentation for separate versions of ops.
The published docs at [ops.readthedocs.io](https://ops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
are always for the in-development (main branch) of ops, and do not include
any notes indicating changes or additions across ops versions.
We encourage all charmers to promptly upgrade to the latest version of ops,
and to refer to the release notes and changelog for learning about changes.

We do note when features behave differently when using different versions of Juju.

In docstrings:

* Use `.. jujuadded:: x.y` to indicate that the feature is only available
  when using version x.y (or higher) of Juju.
* Use `..jujuchanged:: x.y` when the feature's behaviour _in ops_ changes.
* Use `..jujuremoved:: x.y` when the feature will be available in ops
  but not in that version (or later) of Juju.

Similar directives also work in MyST Markdown. For example:

````markdown
```{jujuadded} x.y
Summary
```
````

Unmarked features are assumed to work and be available in the current LTS version of Juju.

# Maintaining the documentation

## How to Pull in Style Changes

The documentation uses Canonical styling which is customised on top of the [Furo Sphinx theme](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo). The easiest way to pull in Canonical style changes is by using the Canonical documentation starter pack, see [docs](https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/) and [repository](https://github.com/canonical/sphinx-docs-starter-pack).

TL;DR:

- Clone the starter pack repository to a local directory: `git clone git@github.com:canonical/sphinx-docs-starter-pack`.
- Copy the folder `.sphinx` under the starter pack repo to the operator repo `docs/.sphinx`.

## How to Customise Configurations

There are two configuration files: [`docs/conf.py`](./docs/conf.py) and [`docs/custom_conf.py`](./docs/custom_conf.py), copied and customised from the starter pack repo.

To customise, change the file [`docs/custom_conf.py`](./docs/custom_conf.py) only, and theoretically, we should not change [`docs/conf.py`](./docs/conf.py) (however, some changes are made to [`docs/conf.py`](./docs/conf.py), such as adding autodoc, PATH, fixing issues, etc.)

## How to Pull in Dependency Changes

The Canonical documentation starter pack uses Make to build the documentation, which will run the script [`docs/.sphinx/build_requirements.py`](./docs/.sphinx/build_requirements.py) and generate a requirement file `requirements.txt` under `docs/.sphinx/`.

To pull in new dependency changes from the starter pack, change to the starter pack repository directory, and build with the following command. This will create a virtual environment, generate a dependency file, install the software dependencies, and build the documentation:

```bash
make html
```

Then, compare the generated file `.sphinx/requirements.txt`and the `project.optional-dependencies.docs` section of [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) and adjust the `pyproject.toml` file accordingly.

# Dependencies

The Python dependencies of `ops` are kept as minimal as possible, to avoid
bloat and to minimise conflict with the charm's dependencies. The dependencies
are listed in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) in the `project.dependencies` section.

# Dev Tools

## Formatting and Checking

Test environments are managed with [tox](https://tox.wiki/) and executed with
[pytest](https://pytest.org), with coverage measured by
[coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/).
Static type checking is done using [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
and extends the Python 3.8 type hinting support through the
[typing_extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/) package.

Formatting uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

All tool configuration is kept in [project.toml](pyproject.toml). The list of
dependencies can be found in the relevant `tox.ini` environment `deps` field.

## Building

The build backend is [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/), and
the build frontend is [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/).

# Publishing a Release

To make a release of the `ops` and/or `ops-scenario` packages, do the following:

1. Check if there's a `chore: update charm pins` auto-generated PR in the queue.
   If it looks good, merge it and check that tests still pass. If needed, you
   can re-trigger the `Update Charm Pins` workflow manually to ensure latest
   charms and ops get tested.
2. Visit the [releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/operator/releases).
3. Click "Draft a new release"
4. The "Release Title" is the full version numbers of ops and/or ops-scenario,
   in the form `ops <major>.<minor>.<patch> and ops-scenario <major>.<minor>.<patch>`
   and a brief summary of the main changes in the release.
   For example: `2.3.12 Bug fixes for the Juju foobar feature when using Python 3.12`
5. Have the release create a new tag, in the form `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` for
   `ops` and `scenario-<major>.<minor>.<patch>` for `ops-scenario`. If releasing
   both packages, use the ops tag.
6. If the last release was for both `ops` and `ops-scenario`, leave the previous
   tag choice on `auto`. If the last release was for only one package, change
   the previous tag to be the last time the same package(s) were being released.
7. Use the "Generate Release Notes" button to get a copy of the changes into the
   notes field. The 'Release Documentation' section below details the form that
   the release notes and changelog should take.
8. For `ops`, change [version.py](ops/version.py)'s `version` to the
   appropriate string. For `ops-scenario`, change the version in
   [testing/pyproject.toml](testing/pyproject.toml). Both packages use
   [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), and adjust independently
   (that is: ops 2.18 doesn't imply ops-scenario 2.18, or any other number).
9. Run `uvx -p 3.11 tox -e docs-deps` to recompile the `requirements.txt` file
   used for docs (in case dependencies have been updated in `pyproject.toml`)
   using the same Python version as specified in the `.readthedocs.yaml` file.
10. Add, commit, and push, and open a PR to get the changelogs, version bumps,
   and doc requirement bumps into main (and get it merged).
11. Save the release notes as a draft, and have someone else in the Charm-Tech
   team proofread the release notes.
12. If the release includes both `ops` and `ops-scenario` packages, then push a
   new tag in the form `scenario-<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. This is done by
   executing `git tag scenario-x.y.z`, then `git push upstream tag scenario-x.y.z` locally
   (assuming you have configured `canonical/operator` as a remote named
   `upstream`).
13. When you are ready, click "Publish". GitHub will create the additional tag.

    Pushing the tags will trigger automatic builds for the Python packages and
    publish them to PyPI ([ops](https://pypi.org/project/ops/) and
    [ops-scenario](https://pypi.org/project/ops-scenario)) (authorisation is handled
    via a [Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) relationship).
    Note that it sometimes take a bit of time for the new releases to show up.

    See [.github/workflows/publish-ops.yaml](.github/workflows/publish-ops.yaml) and
    [.github/workflows/publish-ops-scenario.yaml](.github/workflows/publish-ops-scenario.yaml) for details.
    (Note that the versions in the YAML refer to versions of the GitHub actions, not the versions of the ops  library.)

    You can troubleshoot errors on the [Actions Tab](https://github.com/canonical/operator/actions).

14. Announce the release on [Discourse](https://discourse.charmhub.io/c/framework/42) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#charmhub-charmdev:ubuntu.com).

15. Open a PR to change the version strings to the expected
   next version, with ".dev0" appended (for example, if 3.14.1 is the next
   expected version, use `'3.14.1.dev0'`).

## Release Documentation

We produce several pieces of documentation for `ops` and `ops-scenario`
releases, each serving a separate purpose and covering a different level.

Avoid using the word "Scenario", preferring "unit testing API" or "state
transition testing". Users should install `ops-scenario` with
`pip install ops[testing]` rather than using the `ops-scenario` package name
directly.

### `git log`

`git log` is used to see every change since a previous release. Obviously, no
special work needs to be done so that this is available. A link to the GitHub
view of the log will be included at the end of the GitHub release notes when
the "Generate Release Notes" button is used, in the form:

```
**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/canonical/operator/compare/2.17.0...2.18.0
```

These changes include both `ops` and `ops-scenario`. If someone needs to see
changes only for one of the packages, then the `/testing/` folder can be
filtered in/out.

### CHANGES.md

A changelog is kept in version control that simply lists the changes in each
release, other than chores. The changelog for `ops`
is at the top level, in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md), and the changelog for
`ops-scenario` is in the `/testing` folder, [CHANGES.md](testing/CHANGES.md).
There will be overlap between the two files, as many PRs will include changes to
common infrastructure, or will adjust both `ops` and also the testing API in
`ops-scenario`.

Adding the changes is done in preparation for a release. Use the "Generate
Release Notes" button in the GitHub releases page, and copy the text to the
CHANGES.md files.

* Group the changes by the commit type (feat, fix, and so on) and use full names
  ("Features", not "feat", "Fixes", not "fix") for group headings.
* Remove any chores.
* Remove any bullets that do not apply to the package. For instance, if a bullet
  only affects `ops[testing]`, don't include it in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) when
  doing an `ops` release. The bullet should go in [testing/CHANGES.md](testing/CHANGES.md)
  instead. If `ops[testing]` is not being released yet, put the bullet in a placeholder
  section at top of [testing/CHANGES.md](testing/CHANGES.md).
* Strip the commit type prefix from the bullet point, and capitalise the first
  word.
* Strip the username (who did each commit) if the author is a member of the
  Charm Tech team.
* Replace the link to the pull request with the PR number in parentheses.
* Where appropriate, collapse multiple tightly related bullet points into a
  single point that refers to multiple commits.
* Where appropriate, add backticks for code formatting.

For example: the PR

```
* docs: clarify where StoredState is stored by @benhoyt in https://github.com/canonical/operator/pull/2006
```

is added to the "Documentation" section as:

```
* Clarify where StoredState is stored (#2006)
```

### GitHub Release Notes

The GitHub release notes include the list of changes found in the changelogs,
but:

* If both `ops` and `ops-scenario` packages are being released, include all the
  changes in the same set of release notes. If only one package is being
  released, remove any bullets that apply only to the other package.
* The links to the PRs are left in full.
* Add a section above the list of changes that briefly outlines any key changes
  in the release.

### Discourse Release Announcement

Post to the [framework category](https://discourse.charmhub.io/c/framework/42)
with a subject matching the GitHub release title.

The post should resemble this:

```
The Charm Tech team has just released version x.y.z of ops!

It‚Äôs available from PyPI by using `pip install ops`, and `pip install ops[testing]`,
which will pick up the latest version. Upgrade by running `pip install --upgrade ops`.

The main improvements in this release are ...

Read more in the [full release notes on GitHub](link to the GitHub release).
```

In the post, outline the key improvements both in `ops` and `ops-scenario`.
The point here is to encourage people to check out the full notes and to upgrade
promptly, so ensure that you entice them with the best that the new versions
have to offer.
