# Ops Tools

A collection of tools to use when developing and maintaining Ops charms.

## charmcraft.yaml generation

The definition of charm configuration options and actions should have a single source of truth. Our preference is that truth is in the charm code: this is in an expressive language (Python), that allows more complex type definitions and validation than possible in the Juju config schema language or action parameter JSONSchema. However, Juju and Charmcraft need to find these schema in the `charmcraft.yaml` file.

The package provides tooling to generate the appropriate `charmcraft.yaml` sections for `config` and `actions` from config and action classes in the charm Python code.

### Usage

For example, if your charm contains a single config class in `src/charm.py` called `Config` and three actions, which all end with 'Action' (and no other classes have that name):

```bash
update-charmcraft-schema --config-class Config --action-class '.+Action'
```

If you have a config class in `src/workload.py` called `WorkloadConfig` and one in `src/charm.py` called `AdditionalConfig`:

```bash
update-charmcraft-schema --config-class src.workload:WorkloadConfig --config-class src.charm:AdditionalConfig
```

This command can be included in a pre-commit configuration, or CI workflow, to ensure that the `charmcraft.yaml` file is always in sync with the Python classes.

### Example output

The config class:

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class MyConfig:
    my_str: str = "foo"
    '''A string value.'''
    my_secret: ops.Secret | None = None
    '''A user secret.'''
```

would generate this YAML:

```yaml
config:
    options:
        my-str:
            type: string
            default: foo
            description: A string value.
        my-secret:
            type: secret
            description: A user secret.
```

And the action class:

```python
class Compression(enum.Enum):
    GZ = 'gzip'
    BZ = 'bzip2'

@dataclasses.dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class RunBackupAction:
    '''Backup the database.'''

    filename: str
    '''The name of the backup file.'''
    compression: Compression = Compression.GZ
    '''The type of compression to use.'''
```

would generate this YAML:

```yaml
actions:
    run-backup:
        description: Backup the database.
        params:
            filename:
                type: string
                description: The name of the backup file.
            compression:
                type: string
                description: The type of compression to use.
                default: gzip
                enum: [gzip, bzip2]
        required: [filename]
        additionalProperties: false
```

Type annotations for all classes must use the modern `a | b` and `a | None` form, rather than `Union[a, b]` or `Optional[a]`.
