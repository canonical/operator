    - When the app config changes, for example when `juju trust` is run.

    :attr:`collect_app_status <CharmEvents.collect_app_status>` or
    :attr:`collect_unit_status <CharmEvents.collect_unit_status>` event,
    respectively.

    The framework will trigger these events after the hook code runs
    successfully (``collect_app_status`` will only be triggered on the leader
    unit). This happens on every Juju event, whether it was
    :meth:`observed <ops.Framework.observe>` or not.
    If any statuses were added by the event handler using
    :meth:`add_status`, the framework will choose the highest-priority status
    and set that as the status (application status for ``collect_app_status``,
    or unit status for ``collect_unit_status``).

    The order of priorities is as follows, from highest to lowest:

    * blocked
    * maintenance
    * waiting
    * active

    It is an error to call :meth:`add_status` with an instance of
    :class:`ErrorStatus` or :class:`UnknownStatus`.

    If there are multiple statuses with the same priority, the first one added
    wins (and if an event is observed multiple times, the handlers are called
    in the order they were observed).

    A collect-status event can be observed multiple times, and
    :meth:`add_status` can be called multiple times to add multiple statuses
    for evaluation. This is useful when a charm has multiple components that
    each have a status. Each code path in a collect-status handler should
    call ``add_status`` at least once.

    Below is an example "web app" charm component that observes
    ``collect_unit_status`` to provide the status of the component, which
