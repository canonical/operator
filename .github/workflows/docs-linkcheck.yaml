  # The docs have a lot of external links, so the link checker takes a long time to run.
  # As of Oct 2025, the link checker fails on many Read the Docs links because RTD's
  # servers respond with 429 (Too Many Requests) without allowing retry after delay.
  # Given this, it's best to run the workflow manually and inspect the results.
