# Explanation

These guides explain how Ops works.

## Interface definitions

The `charm-relation-interfaces` repository contains specifications, schemas, and tests for Juju interfaces.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

charm-relation-interfaces
```

## Testing

Your charm should have unit tests and integration tests. If your charm uses relations, it should also have interface tests.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

testing
```

State-transition tests are the recommend way to write charm unit tests. They have replaced the older "Harness" framework. For guidance on how to upgrade to state-transition tests, see [](#harness-migration).

## Tracing

Ops enables you to trace your charm code and send data to sources such as the [Canonical Observability Stack](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/observability/).

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

```

## Handling events

Charms typically either handle events holistically, using a shared reconciler method, or individually.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

```

The `defer()` mechanism in Ops is convenient, but has some limitations.

```{toctree}

```

## Security

As you write your charm, follow good security practices and produce security documentation for your charm.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

```

## Charm maturity

Your charm should increase in maturity and quality over time, especially if you plan for it to be publicly listed on Charmhub.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

charm-maturity
```

## Tracking state

Charms can track state in several ways, including using `ops.StoredState`. You should be judicious when deciding how to track state.

```{toctree}
