Assuming you are familiar with Juju, you will know that to start using a charm you should run `juju deploy thischarm`. When you run this command targeting a Kubernetes cloud, the following things happen:
-->

<!--
If you are familiar with  Juju, as we assume here, you'll know that, to start using a charm, you run `juju deploy`, and also that, when you do that on a Kubernetes-type cloud, this triggers all of the following: 
-->

As you already know from your knowledge of Juju, when you deploy a Kubernetes charm, the following things happen:

1. The Juju controller provisions a pod with two containers, one for the Juju unit agent and the charm itself and one container for each application workload container that is specified in the `containers` field of a file in the charm that is called `charmcraft.yaml`. 
1. The same Juju controller injects Pebble -- a lightweight, API-driven process supervisor -- into each workload container and overrides the container entrypoint so that Pebble starts when the container is ready. 
1. When the Kubernetes API reports that a workload container is ready, the Juju controller informs the charm that the instance of Pebble in that container is ready. At that point, the charm knows that it can start communicating with Pebble. 
1. Typically, at this point the charm will make calls to Pebble so that Pebble can configure and start the workload and begin operations. 

> Note: In the past, the containers were specified in a `metadata.yaml` file, but the modern practice is that all charm specification is in a single `charmcraft.yaml` file.

<!--the container for the unit agent and the charm is named 'charm'-->
<!--PIETRO'S ORIGINAL WORDING:
1. Typically, at this point the charm will configure and start its workload (through pebble calls) and begin operations. 
-->

<!--Pebble is a lightweight, API-driven process supervisor designed to give workload containers something akin to an `init` system that will allow the charm container to interact with it. -->
<!--The charm already knows how to contact Pebble (because the information can be predicted from the container name).
<!--
Conceptually, a charm is code that instructs Juju to deploy and manage an application in the cloud. For every Kubernetes charm Juju will deploy a pod with two containers, one for the Juju agent and the charm code and one for the application workload. The communication between these containers, and the orchestration of the local service processes for the workload application, both happen via Pebble, a lightweight API-driven process supervisor. For a visual representation of the deployment see the picture below. 
-->

All  subsequent workload management happens in the same way -- the Juju controller sends events to the charm and the charm responds to these events by managing the workload application in various ways via Pebble. The picture below illustrates all of this for a simple case where there is just one workload container.


![Create a minimal Kubernetes charm](../../resources/create_a_minimal_kubernetes_charm.png)


As a charm developer, your first job is to use this knowledge to create the basic structure and content for your charm:

 - descriptive files (e.g., YAML configuration files like the `charmcraft.yaml` file mentioned above) that give Juju, Python, or Charmcraft various bits of information about your charm, and 
- executable files (like the `src/charm.py` file that we will see shortly) where you will use Ops-enriched Python to write all the logic of your charm.


## Set the basic information, requirements, and workload for your charm

Create a file called `charmcraft.yaml`. This is a file that describes metadata such as the charm name, purpose, environment constraints, workload containers, etc., in short, all the information that tells Juju what it can do with your charm.

In this file, do all of the following:

First, add basic information about your charm:

```text
name: demo-api-charm
title: |
  demo-fastapi-k8s
description: |
  This is a demo charm built on top of a small Python FastAPI server.
  This charm could be related to PostgreSQL charm and COS Lite bundle (Canonical Observability Stack).
summary: |
  FastAPI Demo charm for Kubernetes
```

Second, add an environment constraint assuming the latest major Juju version and a Kubernetes-type cloud:

```text
assumes:
  - juju >= 3.1
  - k8s-api
```

Third, describe the workload container, as below. Below, `demo-server` is the name of the container, and `demo-server-image` is the name of its OCI image.

```text
containers:
  demo-server:
    resource: demo-server-image
``` 


Fourth, describe the workload container resources, as below. The name of the resource below, `demo-server-image`, is the one you defined above.

```text
resources:
  # An OCI image resource for each container listed above.
  # You may remove this if your charm will run without a workload sidecar container.
  demo-server-image:
    type: oci-image
    description: OCI image from GitHub Container Repository
    # The upstream-source field is ignored by Juju. It is included here as a reference
    # so the integration testing suite knows which image to deploy during testing. This field
    # is also used by the 'canonical/charming-actions' Github action for automated releasing.
    upstream-source: ghcr.io/canonical/api_demo_server:1.0.1
```



## Define the charm initialisation and application services

<!--
The recommended way to develop charms is by using a Python library called Ops (`ops`) (also known as the Charmed Operator Framework, as in 'the framework for building charmed operators'). 
-->

Create a file called `requirements.txt`. This is a  file that describes all the required external Python dependencies that will be used by your charm. 


In this file, declare the `ops` dependency, as below. At this point you're ready to start using constructs from the Ops library.

```
ops >= 2.11
```


Create a file called `src/charm.py`. This is the file that you will use to write all the Python code that you want your charm to execute in response to events it receives from the Juju controller.


This file needs to be executable. One way you can do this is:

```text
chmod a+x src/charm.py
```

In this file, do all of the following:

First, add a shebang to ensure that the file is directly executable. Then, import the `ops` package to access the`CharmBase` class and the `main` function. Next, use `CharmBase` to create a charm class `FastAPIDemoCharm` and then invoke this class  in the  `main` function of Ops. As you can see, a charm  is a pure Python class that inherits from the CharmBase class of Ops and which we pass to the `main` function defined in the `ops.main` module.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import ops

class FastAPIDemoCharm(ops.CharmBase):
    """Charm the service."""

    def __init__(self, framework: ops.Framework) -> None:
        super().__init__(framework)

if __name__ == "__main__":  # pragma: nocover
    ops.main(FastAPIDemoCharm)

```


Now, in the `__init__` function of your charm class, use Ops constructs to add an observer for when the Juju controller informs the charm that the Pebble in its workload container is up and running, as below. As you can see, the observer is a function that takes as an argument an event and an event handler. The event name is created automatically by Ops for each container on the template `<container>-pebble-ready`. The event handler is a method in your charm class that will be executed when the event is fired; in this case, you will use it to tell Pebble how to start your application.

```python
framework.observe(self.on.demo_server_pebble_ready, self._on_demo_server_pebble_ready)
```


```{important}

**Generally speaking:** A charm class is a collection of event handling methods. When you want to install, remove, upgrade, configure, etc., an application, Juju sends information to your charm. Ops translates this information into events and your job is to write event handlers

```

```{tip}

**Pro tip:** Use `__init__` to hold references (pointers) to other `Object`s or immutable state only. That is because a charm is reinitialised on every event.

```

<!--
TOO ADVANCED:
Pro tip:** Use `__init__` to hold references (pointers) to other objects (e.g., relation wrappers) or immutable state only. That is because a fresh charm instance is created on every event, so attaching mutable state to it is error-prone. (You should rather think of all data attached to a charm instance as single-use.) See {ref}`Talking to a workload: Control flow from A to Z <talking-to-a-workload-control-flow-from-a-to-z>`.

"relation wrapper" is advanced Pietro jargon:

like, the FooRelationProvider/FooRelationRequirer objects most relation charm libs offer

these are objects that wrap a relation (a relation endpoint, to be more precise) and expose a high-level API to the charm

so that instead of read/writing relation data directly, the charm can call methods on the wrapper that will take care of the low-level work

not sure if it's generally adopted terminology, but I call them relation endpoint wrappers

-->


Next, define the event handler, as follows:

We'll use the `ActiveStatus` class to set the charm status to active. Note that almost everything you need to define your charm is in the `ops` package that you imported earlier - there's no need to add additional imports.

Use `ActiveStatus` as well as further Ops constructs to define the event handler, as below. As you can see, what is happening is that, from the `event` argument, you extract the workload container object in which you add a custom layer. Once the layer is set you replan your service and set the charm status to active.

<!--
In case it helps, the definition of a Pebble layer is very similar to the definition of a Linux service.
-->


```python
def _on_demo_server_pebble_ready(self, event: ops.PebbleReadyEvent)  -> None:
    """Define and start a workload using the Pebble API.

    Change this example to suit your needs. You'll need to specify the right entrypoint and
    environment configuration for your specific workload.

    Learn more about interacting with Pebble at at https://juju.is/docs/sdk/pebble
    Learn more about Pebble layers at
        https://canonical-pebble.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/reference/layers
    """
    # Get a reference the container attribute on the PebbleReadyEvent
    container = event.workload
    # Add initial Pebble config layer using the Pebble API
    container.add_layer("fastapi_demo", self._pebble_layer, combine=True)
    # Make Pebble reevaluate its plan, ensuring any services are started if enabled.
    container.replan()
    # Learn more about statuses in the SDK docs:
    # https://juju.is/docs/sdk/status
    self.unit.status = ops.ActiveStatus()
```

The custom Pebble layer that you just added is defined in the  `self._pebble_layer` property. Update this property to match your application, as follows:

In the `__init__` method of your charm class, name your service to `fastapi-service` and add it as a class attribute :

```
self.pebble_service_name = "fastapi-service"
```

Finally, define  the `pebble_layer` function as below. The `command` variable represents a command line that should be executed in order to start our application.

```python
@property
def _pebble_layer(self) -> ops.pebble.Layer:
    """A Pebble layer for the FastAPI demo services."""
    command = ' '.join(
        [
            'uvicorn',
            'api_demo_server.app:app',
            '--host=0.0.0.0',
            '--port=8000',
        ]
    )
    pebble_layer: ops.pebble.LayerDict = {
        'summary': 'FastAPI demo service',
        'description': 'pebble config layer for FastAPI demo server',
        'services': {
            self.pebble_service_name: {
                'override': 'replace',
                'summary': 'fastapi demo',
                'command': command,
                'startup': 'enabled',
            }
        },
    }
    return ops.pebble.Layer(pebble_layer)
```



## Add logger functionality

In the `src/charm.py` file, in the imports section, import the Python `logging` module and define a logger object, as below. This will allow you to read log data in `juju`.

```
import logging

# Log messages can be retrieved using juju debug-log
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

## Tell Charmcraft how to build your charm

In the same `charmcraft.yaml` file you created earlier, you need to describe all the information needed for Charmcraft to be able to pack your charm. In this file, do the following:

First, add the block below. This will identify your charm as a charm (as opposed to something else you might know from using Juju, namely, a bundle).

```
type: charm
```


Also add the block below. This declares that your charm will build and run charm on Ubuntu 22.04. 

```
bases:
  - build-on:
    - name: ubuntu
      channel: "22.04"
    run-on:
    - name: ubuntu
      channel: "22.04"
```


Aaaand that's it! Time to validate your charm!

```{tip}

Once you've mastered the basics, you can speed things up by navigating to your empty charm project directory and running `charmcraft init --profile kubernetes`. This will create all the files above and more, along with helpful descriptor keys and code scaffolding.

```


## Validate your charm

First, ensure that you are inside the Multipass Ubuntu VM, in the `~/fastapi-demo` folder:

```
multipass shell charm-dev
cd ~/fastapi-demo
```

Now, pack your charm project directory into a `.charm` file, as below. This will produce a `.charm` file.  In our case it was named `demo-api-charm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm`; yours should be named similarly, though the name might vary slightly depending on your architecture.

```
charmcraft pack
# Packed demo-api-charm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm
```

```{important}

If packing failed - perhaps you forgot to make the charm.py executable earlier - you may need to run `charmcraft clean` before re-running `charmcraft pack`. `charmcraft` will generally detect when files have changed, but will miss only file attributes changing.

```

```{important}

**Did you know?** A `.charm` file is really just a zip file of your charm files and code dependencies that makes it more convenient to share, publish, and retrieve your charm contents. 

```

<!--ubuntu@charm-dev:~/fastapi-demo$ charmcraft pack-->

<!-- `charmcraft pack` just fetches the dependencies, compiles any modules, makes sure you have all the right pieces of metadata, and zips it up for easy distribution.
-->

<!--```{caution}

This name might vary slightly, depending on your architecture. E.g., for an `arm` processor, you will see `arm64` rather than `amd64`. In the commands below make sure to enter the correct charm name.

```
-->

Deploy the `.charm` file, as below. Juju will create a Kubernetes `StatefulSet` named after your application with one replica.

```text
juju deploy ./demo-api-charm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm --resource \
     demo-server-image=ghcr.io/canonical/api_demo_server:1.0.1
```


```{important}

**If you've never deployed a local charm (i.e., a charm from a location on your machine) before:** <br> As you may know, when you deploy a charm from Charmhub it is sufficient to run `juju deploy <charm name>`. However, to deploy a local charm you need to explicitly define a `--resource` parameter with the same resource name and resource upstream source as in the `charmcraft.yaml`.

```


Monitor your deployment:

```text
juju status --watch 1s
```

When all units are settled down, you should see the output below, where `10.152.183.215` is the IP of the K8s Service and `10.1.157.73` is the IP of the pod.

```
Model        Controller           Cloud/Region        Version  SLA          Timestamp
welcome-k8s  tutorial-controller  microk8s/localhost  3.0.0    unsupported  13:38:19+01:00

App             Version  Status  Scale  Charm           Channel  Rev  Address         Exposed  Message
demo-api-charm           active      1  demo-api-charm             1  10.152.183.215  no       

Unit               Workload  Agent  Address      Ports  Message
demo-api-charm/0*  active    idle   10.1.157.73  
```

Now, validate that the app is running and reachable by sending an HTTP  request as below, where `10.1.157.73` is the IP of our pod and `8000` is the default application port.  

```
curl 10.1.157.73:8000/version
```

You should see a JSON string with the version of the application: 

```
{"version":"1.0.0"}
```


```{dropdown} Expand if you wish to inspect your deployment further


1. Run:

```text
kubectl get namespaces
```

You should see that Juju has created a namespace called `welcome-k8s`.

2. Try:

```text
kubectl -n welcome-k8s get pods
```

You should see that your application has been deployed in a pod that has 2 containers running in it, one for the charm and one for the application. The containers talk to each other via the Pebble API using the UNIX socket.

```text
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
modeloperator-5df6588d89-ghxtz   1/1     Running   3 (7d2h ago)    13d
demo-api-charm-0                 2/2     Running   0               7d2h
```

3. Check also:

```text
kubectl -n welcome-k8s describe pod demo-api-charm-0
```
In the output you should see the definition for both containers. You'll be able to verify that the default command and arguments for our application container (`demo-server`) have been displaced by the Pebble service. You should be able to verify the same for the charm container (`charm`).

**Congratulations, you've successfully created a minimal Kubernetes charm!**
