# From zero to hero: Write your first Kubernetes charm

This tutorial will teach you how to write a Kubernetes charm for an application.

By the end of the tutorial, you'll have equipped the application with operational logic and used Juju to deploy the application to a local Kubernetes cluster.
You'll also have learned how to implement typical functionality of a charm, including configuration, relations, and actions.

```{important}

**Did you know?** Writing a charm is also known as 'charming'!

```

## What you'll need

- A workstation. For example, a laptop with an amd64 architecture. 
- Familiarity with the Python programming language, including Object-Oriented Programming and event handlers.

It will also help if you are familiar with Juju and have an understanding of
Kubernetes fundamentals, but don't worry if you're new to these topics. This
tutorial will guide you though each step.
