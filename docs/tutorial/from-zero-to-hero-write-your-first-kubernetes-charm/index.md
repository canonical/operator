# From zero to hero: Write your first Kubernetes charm

This tutorial will introduce you to the official way to write a Kubernetes charm --- that is, how to equip an application with all the operational logic that it needs so that you can manage it on any Kubernetes cloud with just a few commands, using Juju. 

```{important}

**Did you know?** Writing a charm is also known as 'charming'!

```

## What you'll need

- A workstation. For example, a laptop with an amd64 architecture. 
- Familiarity with the Python programming language, including Object-Oriented Programming and event handlers.

It will also help if you are familiar with Juju and have an understanding of
Kubernetes fundamentals, but don't worry if you're new to these topics. This
tutorial will guide you though each step.

## What you'll do
