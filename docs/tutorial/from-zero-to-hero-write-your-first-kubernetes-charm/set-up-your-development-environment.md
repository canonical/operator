In this chapter of the tutorial you will set up your development environment. 

You will need a charm directory, the various tools in the charm SDK, Juju, and a Kubernetes cloud. And itâ€™s a good idea if you can do all your work in an isolated development environment. 

You can get all of this by following our generic development setup guide, with some annotations. 

> See [Set up / tear down automatically](https://juju.is/docs/juju/set-up--tear-down-your-test-environment#set-up-tear-down-automatically), with the following changes:
> - At the directory step, call your directory `fastapi-demo`. 
> - At the VM setup step, call your VM `charm-dev` and also set up Docker: 
>     1. `sudo addgroup --system docker`
>     1. `sudo adduser $USER docker`
>     1. `newgrp docker`
>     1. `sudo snap install docker`.
> - At the cloud selection step, choose `microk8s`. 
> - At the mount step: Make sure to read the box with tips on how to edit files locally while running them inside the VM! <br><br>
> All set!



Congratulations, your development environment is now ready!
