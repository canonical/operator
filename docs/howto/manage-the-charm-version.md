# How to manage the charm version

## Implement the feature

Charms can specify a version of the charm itself, so that a Juju admin can track
the installed version of the charm back to the source tree that it was built
from.

To set the version, in the root directory of your charm (at the same level as
the `charmcraft.yaml` file) add a file called `version` (no extension). The
content of the file is the version string, which is typically a
major.minor.patch style version that's manually updated, or a version control
hash identifier.

For example, using the hash of the latest HEAD commit as the version:

```shell
$ git rev-parse HEAD > version
$ ls
lib      src    tox.ini charmcraft.yaml  LICENSE  requirements.txt  tests  version
$ cat version
0522e1fd009dac78adb3d0652d91a1e8ff7982ae
```

```{note}

Normally, your publishing workflow would take care of updating this file, so
that it will automatically match the revision that you're publishing. Generally,
using a version control revision is the best choice, as it unambiguously
identifies the code that was used to build the charm.

```

Juju admins using your charm can find this information with `juju status` in the
YAML or JSON formats in the `applications.<app name>.charm-version` field. If
there is no version, the key will not be present in the status output.

Note that this is distinct from the charm **revision**, which is set when
uploading a charm to CharmHub (or when deploying/refreshing for local charms).

> Examples: [`container-log-archive-charm` sets `version` to a version control hash](https://git.launchpad.net/container-log-archive-charm/tree/)

## Test the feature

> See first: {ref}`get-started-with-charm-testing`

Since the version isn't set by the charm code itself, you'll want to test that
the version is correctly set with an integration test, and don't need to write
a unit test.

> See first: {ref}`write-integration-tests-for-a-charm`

To verify that setting the charm version works correctly in an integration test,
in your `tests/integration/test_charm.py` file, add a new test after the
`test_build_and_deploy` one that `charmcraft init` provides. In this test, get
the status of the model, and check the `charm_version` attribute of the unit.
For example:

```python
# `charmcraft init` will provide this test for you.
async def test_build_and_deploy(ops_test: OpsTest):
    # Build and deploy charm from local source folder
    charm = await ops_test.build_charm(".")

    # Deploy the charm and wait for active/idle status
    await asyncio.gather(
        ops_test.model.deploy(charm, application_name=APP_NAME),
        ops_test.model.wait_for_idle(
            apps=[APP_NAME], status="active", raise_on_blocked=True, timeout=1000
        ),
    )

async def test_charm_version_is_set(ops_test: OpsTest):
    # Verify that the charm version has been set.
    status = await ops_test.model.get_status()
    version = status.applications[APP_NAME].charm_version
    expected_version = subprocess.check_output(["git", "rev-parse", "HEAD"]).decode("utf8")
    assert version == expected_version
```
