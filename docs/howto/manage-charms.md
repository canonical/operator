> See first: {external+juju:ref}`Juju | Build a charm <build-a-charm>`, {external+charmcraft:ref}`Charmcraft | Manage charms <manage-charms>`

## Prepare your environment

You'll need the following tools:

- Charmcraft. See {external+charmcraft:ref}`Charmcraft | Manage Charmcraft <manage-charmcraft>`.
- tox. See the [tox installation instructions](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/installation.html#as-tool).

Instead of installing these tools manually, consider using the `charm-dev` [Multipass](https://canonical.com/multipass) blueprint or [`concierge`](https://github.com/canonical/concierge) to prepare your environment.

## Initialise your charm project

Use Charmcraft to quickly initialise your charm project. This generates the
folder structure, creates placeholder configuration and code files, and
configures development tooling.

## Develop your charm

The Charmcraft profile has configured some commands to help you develop your charm:

- Run `tox` to format and lint the code, and run static type checking and the
  charm unit tests.
- Run `tox -e integration` to run the charm integration tests.
- Run `tox list` to see the available commands.

```{admonition} Best practice
:class: hint

All charms should provide the commands configured by the Charmcraft profile, to
allow easy testing across the charm ecosystem. It's fine to tweak the
configuration of individual tools, or to add additional commands, but keep the
command names and meanings that the profile provides.
```

The following tools can also be useful during development:

- To prepare an environment for running integration tests, such as in continuous integration, use [`concierge`](https://github.com/canonical/concierge) or [`actions-operator`](https://github.com/charmed-kubernetes/actions-operator).
- The [`charming-actions`](https://github.com/canonical/charming-actions) repository includes actions to ensure that libraries are up-to-date, publish charms and libraries, and more.

```{admonition} Best practice
:class: hint

The quality assurance pipeline of a charm should be automated using a
continuous integration (CI) system.
```

The essence of a charm is the ``src/charm.py`` file. This is the entry point for
your code whenever Juju emits an event, and defines the interface between Juju
and the charm workflow.

The next thing to do is add functionality to your charm.
As you do that, you'll frequently pack, test, and debug your charm.

One of the powers of charms is their reusability. As such, do not try to
duplicate functionality already achieved by an existing charm – rather, make
your charm take advantage of the [charm ecosystem](https://charmhub.io) by
supporting integrating with existing charm solutions for observability,
identity, scaling, and so on.

This also helps you stay compliant with another fundamental rule in charms,
namely that, following the Unix philosophy, each charm should do one thing and
do it well.

## Publish your charm

When you're ready, you'll publish your charm on Charmhub.

If your charm depends on resources that are binary files, make sure to provide binaries for all the CPU architectures you intend to support.

A charm is software: while there can be milestones, there is never a finish
line. So, keep investing in every bit of your charm so that it looks and feels
professional – from polishing metadata (including an icon, a website, docs, and
so on) through polishing features (for example, working to ensure correct and
reliable behavior, adding libraries so people can quickly integrate with your
charm, and so on) all the way to turning it into a successful open source
project with a community that enjoys it and wants to contribute to it.
