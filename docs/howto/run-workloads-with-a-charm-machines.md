# How to run workloads with a machine charm

There are several ways your charm might start a workload, depending on the type of charm you're authoring. 

For a machine charm, it is likely that packages will need to be fetched, installed and started to provide the desired charm functionality. This can be achieved by interacting with the system's package manager, ensuring that package and service status is maintained by reacting to events accordingly.

```{admonition} Best practice
:class: hint

Limit the use of shell scripts and commands as much as possible in favour of
writing Python for charm code.
```

It is important to consider which events to respond to in the context of your charm. A simple example might be:

```python
import subprocess

class MachineCharm(ops.CharmBase):
    ...

    def __init__(self, framework: ops.Framework):
        super().__init__(framework)
        framework.observe(self.on.install, self._on_install)
        framework.observe(self.on.start, self._on_start)
        ...

    def _on_install(self, event: ops.InstallEvent):
        """Handle the install event."""
        self.unit.status = ops.MaintenanceStatus("Installing packages")
        try:
            # Install the openssh-server package using apt-get.
            # Consider using the operator-libs-linux apt library instead:
            # https://charmhub.io/operator-libs-linux/libraries/apt
            subprocess.run(
                ["/usr/bin/apt", "install", "-y", "openssh-server"],
                check=True,
                capture_output=True,
            )
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            # If the command returns a non-zero return code, put the charm
            # in blocked state.
            logger.error(
                "Package install failed with return code %d: %r",
                e.returncode,
                e.stderr,
            )
            self.unit.status = ops.BlockedStatus("Failed to install packages")

    def _on_start(self, event: ops.StartEvent):
        """Handle the start event."""
        self.unit.status = ops.MaintenanceStatus("Starting services")
        try:
            # Enable the ssh systemd unit, and start it
            subprocess.run(
                ["/usr/bin/systemctl", "enable", "--now", "openssh-server"],
                check=True,
                capture_output=True,
            )
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            # If the command returns a non-zero return code, put the charm
            # in blocked state.
            logger.error(
                "Starting systemd unit failed with return code %d: %r",
                e.returncode,
                e.sterr,
            )
            self.unit.status = ops.BlockedStatus(
                "Failed to start/enable ssh service"
            )
            return

        # Everything is awesome.
        self.unit.status = ops.ActiveStatus()
```

```{admonition} Best practice
:class: hint

When running subprocesses, log the return (exit) code as well as `stderr` when
errors occur.
```

```{admonition} Best practice
:class: hint

Use absolute paths in subprocesses to prevent security issues.
```

```{admonition} Best practice
:class: hint

Execute processes directly rather than via the shell.
```

If the machine is likely to be long-running and endure multiple upgrades throughout its life, it may be prudent to ensure the package is installed more regularly, and handle the case where it needs upgrading or reinstalling. Consider this excerpt from the [ubuntu-advantage charm code](https://git.launchpad.net/charm-ubuntu-advantage/tree/src/charm.py) (with some additional comments):

```python
class UbuntuAdvantageCharm(ops.CharmBase):
    """Charm to handle ubuntu-advantage installation and configuration"""

    _state = ops.StoredState()

    def __init__(self, framework: ops.Framework):
        super().__init__(framework)
        self._state.set_default(hashed_token=None, package_needs_installing=True, ppa=None)
        framework.observe(self.on.config_changed, self.config_changed)

    def config_changed(self, event):
        """Install and configure ubuntu-advantage tools and attachment"""
        self.unit.status = ops.MaintenanceStatus("Configuring")
        # Helper method to ensure a custom PPA from charm config is present on the system.
        self._handle_ppa_state()
        # Helper method to ensure latest package is installed.
        self._handle_package_state()
        # Handle some ubuntu-advantage specific configuration.
        self._handle_token_state()
        # Set the unit status using a helper _handle_status_state.
        if isinstance(self.unit.status, ops.BlockedStatus):
            return
        self._handle_status_state()
```

In the example above, the package install status is ensured each time the charm's `config-changed` event fires, which should ensure correct state throughout the charm's deployed lifecycle.
