# Legacy how-to guides

These guides cover deprecated approaches to charming.

## Harness

Harness is a deprecated framework for writing unit tests. You should migrate to state-transition tests.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

Migrate unit tests from Harness <migrate-unit-tests-from-harness>
```

## Hooks-based charms

Hooks-based charms use script files instead of Python code with Ops. This isn't a recommended way of writing charms, so you should migrate to Ops.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

Turn a hooks-based charm into an ops charm <turn-a-hooks-based-charm-into-an-ops-charm>
```
