# How to manage interfaces

(register-an-interface)=
## Register an interface


Suppose you have determined that you need to create a new relation interface called `my_fancy_database`. 

Suppose that your interface specification has the following data model:
- the requirer app is supposed to forward a list of tables that it wants to be provisioned by the database provider
- the provider app (the database) at that point will reply with an API endpoint and, for each replica, it will provide a separate secret ID to authenticate the requests

These are the steps you need to take in order to  register it with {ref}``charm-relation-interfaces` <charm-relation-interfaces>`.

- [A bare-minimum example](https://github.com/IronCore864/charm-relation-interfaces/tree/my-fancy-database/interfaces/my_fancy_database/v0)
- [A more realistic example](https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces/tree/main/interfaces/ingress/v1): 
   - As you can see from the [`interface.yaml`](https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces/blob/main/interfaces/ingress/v1/interface.yaml) file, the [`canonical/traefik-k8s-operator` charm](https://github.com/canonical/traefik-k8s-operator) plays the provider role in the interface.
   - The schema of this interface is defined in [`schema.py`](https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces/blob/main/interfaces/ingress/v1/schema.py).
   - You can find out more information about this interface in the [README](https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces/blob/main/interfaces/ingress/v1/README.md).


```


### 1. Clone (a fork of) [the `charm-relation-interfaces` repo](https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces) and set up an interface specification folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces
cd /path/to/charm-relation-interfaces
```

### 2. Make a copy of the template folder
Copy the template folder to a new folder called the same as your interface (with underscores instead of dashes).

```bash
cp -r ./interfaces/__template__ ./interfaces/my_fancy_database
```

At this point you should see this directory structure:

```
# tree ./interfaces/my_fancy_database
./interfaces/my_fancy_database
└── v0
    ├── README.md
    ├── interface.yaml
    ├── interface_tests
    └── schema.py                                     
2 directories, 3 files
```

### 3. Edit `interface.yaml`

Add to `interface.yaml` the charm that owns the reference implementation of the `my_fancy_database` interface. Assuming your `my_fancy_database_charm` plays the `provider` role in the interface, your `interface.yaml` will look like this:

```yaml
# interface.yaml
providers:                                                  
  - name: my-fancy-database-operator  # same as metadata.yaml's .name
    url: https://github.com/your-github-slug/my-fancy-database-operator
```

### 4. Edit `schema.py`

Edit `schema.py` to contain:

```python
# schema.py

from interface_tester.schema_base import DataBagSchema
from pydantic import BaseModel, AnyHttpUrl, Field, Json
import typing


class ProviderUnitData(BaseModel):
    secret_id: str = Field(
        description="Secret ID for the key you need in order to query this unit.",
        title="Query key secret ID",
        examples=["secret:12312323112313123213"],
    )


class ProviderAppData(BaseModel):
    api_endpoint: AnyHttpUrl = Field(
        description="URL to the database's endpoint.",
        title="Endpoint API address",
        examples=["https://example.com/v1/query"],
    )


class ProviderSchema(DataBagSchema):
    app: ProviderAppData
    unit: ProviderUnitData


class RequirerAppData(BaseModel):
    tables: Json[typing.List[str]] = Field(
        description="Tables that the requirer application needs.",
        title="Requested tables.",
        examples=[["users", "passwords"]],
    )


class RequirerSchema(DataBagSchema):
    app: RequirerAppData
    # we can omit `unit` because the requirer makes no use of the unit databags
```

To verify that things work as they should, you can `pip install pytest-interface-tester` and then run `interface_tester discover --include my_fancy_database` from the `charm-relation-interfaces` root.

You should see:

```yaml
- my_fancy_database:
  - v0:
   - provider:
     - <no tests>
     - schema OK
     - charms:
       - my_fancy_database_charm (https://github.com/your-github-slug/my-fancy-database-operator) custom_test_setup=no
   - requirer:
     - <no tests>
     - schema OK
     - <no charms>
```

In particular pay attention to `schema`. If it says `NOT OK` then there is something wrong with the pydantic model.

### 5. Edit `README.md`

Edit the `README.md` file to contain:

```markdown
# `my_fancy_database`

## Overview
This relation interface describes the expected behavior between of any charm claiming to be able to interface with a Fancy Database and the Fancy Database itself.
Other Fancy Database-compatible providers can be used interchangeably as well.

## Usage

Typically, you can use the implementation of this interface from [this charm library](https://github.com/your_org/my_fancy_database_operator/blob/main/lib/charms/my_fancy_database/v0/fancy.py), although charm developers are free to provide alternative libraries as long as they comply with this interface specification.

## Direction
The `my_fancy_database` interface implements a provider/requirer pattern.
The requirer is a charm that wishes to act as a Fancy Database Service consumer, and the provider is a charm exposing a Fancy Database (-compatible API).

/```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Requirer -- tables --> Provider
    Provider -- endpoint, access_keys --> Requirer
/```

## Behavior

The requirer and the provider must adhere to a certain set of criteria to be considered compatible with the interface.

### Requirer

- Is expected to publish a list of tables in the application databag


### Provide

- Is expected to publish an endpoint URL in the application databag
- Is expected to create and grant a Juju Secret containing the access key for each shard and publish its secret ID in the unit databags.

## Relation Data

See the {ref}`\[Pydantic Schema\] <12689md>`


### Requirer

The requirer publishes a list of tables to be created, as a json-encoded list of strings.

#### Example
\```yaml
application_data: {
   "tables": "{ref}`'users', 'passwords']"
}
\```

### Provider

The provider publishes an endpoint url and access keys for each shard.

#### Example
\```
application_data: {
   "api_endpoint": "https://foo.com/query"
},
units_data : {
  "my_fancy_unit/0": {
     "secret_id": "secret:12312321321312312332312323"
  },
  "my_fancy_unit/1": {
     "secret_id": "secret:45646545645645645646545456"
  }
}
\```
```

### 6. Add interface tests

> See more: {ref}`write-tests-for-an-interface`

### 7. Open a PR to [the `charm-relation-interfaces` repo](https://github.com/canonical/charm-relation-interfaces) 

Finally, open a pull request to the `charm-relation-interfaces` repo and drive it to completion, addressing any feedback or concerns that the maintainers may have.


(write-tests-for-an-interface)=
## Write tests for an interface

> See also: {ref}`interface-tests`

Suppose you have an interface specification in {ref}`charm-relation-interfaces`, or you are working on one, and you want to add interface tests. These are the steps you need to take.

We will continue from the running example from {ref}`register-an-interface`. Your starting setup should look like this:

```text
$ tree ./interfaces/my_fancy_database     
./interfaces/my_fancy_database            
└── v0                                    
    ├── interface.yaml                       
    ├── interface_tests                   
    ├── README.md                         
    └── schema.py                         
                                          
2 directories, 3 files                    
```


### Create the test module

Add a file to the `interface_tests` directory called `test_provider.py`.
> touch ./interfaces/my_fancy_database/interface_tests/test_provider.py

### Write a test for the 'negative' path

Write to `test_provider.py` the code below:

```python
from interface_tester import Tester
from scenario import State, Relation


def test_nothing_happens_if_remote_empty():
    # GIVEN that the remote end has not published any tables
    t = Tester(
        State(
            leader=True,
            relations={
                Relation(
                    endpoint="my-fancy-database",  # the name doesn't matter
                    interface="my_fancy_database",
                )
            },
        )
    )
    # WHEN the database charm receives a relation-joined event
    state_out = t.run("my-fancy-database-relation-joined")
    # THEN no data is published to the (local) databags
    t.assert_relation_data_empty()
```

This test verifies part of a 'negative' path: it verifies that if the remote end did not (yet) comply with his part of the contract, then our side did not either.

### Write a test for the 'positive' path

Append to `test_provider.py` the code below:

```python
import json

from interface_tester import Tester
from scenario import State, Relation


def test_contract_happy_path():
    # GIVEN that the remote end has requested tables in the right format
    tables_json = json.dumps(["users", "passwords"])
    t = Tester(
        State(
            leader=True,
            relations=[
                Relation(
                    endpoint="my-fancy-database",  # the name doesn't matter
                    interface="my_fancy_database",
                    remote_app_data={"tables": tables_json},
                )
            ],
        )
    )
    # WHEN the database charm receives a relation-changed event
    state_out = t.run("my-fancy-database-relation-changed")
    # THEN the schema is satisfied (the database charm published all required fields)
    t.assert_schema_valid()
```

This test verifies that the databags of the 'my-fancy-database' relation are valid according to the  pydantic schema you have specified in `schema.py`. 

To check that things work as they should, you can run `interface_tester discover --include my_fancy_database` from the `charm-relation-interfaces` root.

```{note}

Note that the `interface_tester` is installed in the previous how-to guide  [How to register an interface <how-to-register-an-interface>`. If you haven't done it yet, install it by running: `pip install pytest-interface-tester `.

```

You should see:

```yaml
- my_fancy_database:
  - v0:
   - provider:
       - test_contract_happy_path
       - test_nothing_happens_if_remote_empty
     - schema OK
     - charms:
       - my_fancy_database_charm (https://github.com/your-github-slug/my-fancy-database-operator) custom_test_setup=no
   - requirer:
     - <no tests>
     - schema OK
     - <no charms>
```

In particular, pay attention to the `provider` field. If it says `<no tests>` then there is something wrong with your setup, and the collector isn't able to find your test or identify it as a valid test.

Similarly, you can add tests for requirer in `./interfaces/my_fancy_database/v0/interface_tests/test_requirer.py`. Don't forget to edit the `interface.yaml` file in the "requirers" section to add the name of the charm and the URL. See the "Edit `interface.yaml`" section in the previous how-to guide "How to register an interface" for more detail on editing `interface.yaml`. [Here](https://github.com/IronCore864/charm-relation-interfaces/tree/my-fancy-database/interfaces/my_fancy_database/v0) is an example of tests for requirers added.

### Merge in charm-relation-interfaces

You are ready to merge this files in the charm-relation-interfaces repository. Open a PR and drive it to completion.

#### Prepare the charm

In order to be testable by charm-relation-interfaces, the charm needs to expose and configure a fixture. 

```{note}
 
This is because the `fancy-database` interface specification is only supported if the charm is well-configured and has leadership, since it will need to publish data to the application databag.
Also, interface tests are Scenario tests and as such they are mock-based: there is no cloud substrate running, no Juju, no real charm unit in the background. So you need to patch out all calls that cannot be mocked by Scenario, as well as provide enough mocks through State so that the charm is 'ready' to support the interface you are testing.

```

Go to the Fancy Database charm repository root.

```text
cd path/to/my-fancy-database-operator
```

Create a `conftest.py` file under `tests/interface`:

> mkdir ./tests/interface
> touch ./tests/interface/conftest.py

Write in `conftest.py`:

```python
import pytest
from charm import MyFancyDatabaseCharm
from interface_tester import InterfaceTester
from scenario.state import State


@pytest.fixture
def interface_tester(interface_tester: InterfaceTester):
    interface_tester.configure(
        charm_type=MyFancyDatabaseCharm,
        state_template=State(
            leader=True,  # we need leadership
        ),
    )
    # this fixture needs to yield (NOT RETURN!) interface_tester again
    yield interface_tester
```

```{note}

This fixture overrides a homonym pytest fixture that comes with `pytest-interface-tester`.

```


````{note}

You can configure the fixture name, as well as its location, but that needs to happen in the `charm-relation-interfaces` repo. Example:
```
providers:
  - name: my-fancy-database-provider
    url: YOUR_REPO_URL
    test_setup:
      location: tests/interface/conftest.py
      identifier: database_tester
```

````


#### Verifying the `interface_tester` configuration

To verify that the fixture is good enough to pass the interface tests, run the `run_matrix.py` script from the `charm-relation-interfaces` repo:

```bash
cd path/to/charm-relation-interfaces
python run_matrix.py --include my_fancy_database
```

If you run this test, unless you have already merged the interface tests PR to `charm-relation-interfaces`, it will fail with some error message telling you that it's failing to collect the tests for the interface, because by default, `pytest-interface-tester` will try to find tests in the `canonical/charm-relation-interfaces` repo's `main` branch.

To run tests with a branch in your forked repo, run:

```bash
cd path/to/my-forked/charm-relation-interfaces
python run_matrix.py --include my_fancy_database --repo https://github.com/your-github-slug/charm-relation-interfaces --branch my-fancy-database
```

```{note}

In the above command, remember to replace `your-github-slug` to your own slug, change the repo name accordingly (if you have renamed the forked repo), and update the `my-fance-database` branch name from the above command to the branch that contains your tests.

```

Now the tests should be collected and executed. You should get similar output to the following:

```bash
INFO:root:Running tests for interface: my_fancy_database
INFO:root:Running tests for version: v0
INFO:root:Running tests for role: provider

...

+++ Results +++
{
  "my_fancy_database": {
    "v0": {
      "provider": {
        "my-fancy-database-operator": true
      },
      "requirer": {
        "my-fancy-database-operator": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For reference, [here](https://github.com/IronCore864/my-fancy-database-operator) is an example of a bare minimum `my-fancy-database-operator` charm to make the test pass. In the charm, application relation data and unit relation data are set according to our definition (see the beginning part of the previous how-to guide "How to register an interface".

### Troubleshooting and debugging the tests

#### Your charm is missing some configurations/mocks

Solution to this is to add the missing mocks/patches to the `interface_tester` fixture in `conftest.py`.
Essentially, you need to make it so that the charm runtime 'thinks' that everything is normal and ready to process and accept the interface you are testing.
This may mean mocking the presence and connectivity of a container, system calls, substrate API calls, and more.
If you have scenario or unittests in your codebase, you most likely already have all the necessary patches scattered around and it's a matter of collecting them.

Remember that if you run your tests using `run_matrix.py` locally, in your troubleshooting you need to point `interface.yaml` to the branch where you committed your changes as `run_matrix` fetches the charm repositories in order to run the charms:

```text
requirers:
  - name: my-fancy-database-operator
    url: https://my-fancy-database-operator-repo
    branch: branch-with-my-conftest-changes
```
Remember, however, to merge the changes first in the operator repository before merging the pull request to `charm-relation-interfaces`.
