`ops.testing` (was: Scenario)
=============================

Install ops with the ``testing`` extra to use this API; for example:
``pip install ops[testing]``

State-transition tests, previously known as 'Scenario', expect you to define the
Juju state all at once, define the Juju context against which to test the charm,
and fire a single event on the charm to execute its logic. The tests can then
assert that the Juju state has changed as expected.

A very simple test, where the charm has no config, no integrations, the unit
is the leader, and has a `start` handler that sets the status to active might
look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from ops import testing

    def test_base():
        ctx = testing.Context(MyCharm)
        state = testing.State(leader=True)
        out = ctx.run(ctx.on.start(), state)
        assert out.unit_status == testing.ActiveStatus()

These 'state-transition' tests give charm authors a way to test
how the state changes in reaction to events. They are not
necessarily tests of individual methods or functions;
they are testing the 'contract' of the charm: given
a certain state, when a certain event happens, the charm should transition to
another state. Unlike integration tests, they do not test using a real Juju
controller and model, and focus on a single Juju unit.
For simplicity, we refer to them as 'unit' tests.

Writing these tests should nudge you into thinking of a charm as a black-box
'input to output' function. The inputs are:

- Event: why am I, the charm, being executed
- State: am I the leader? what is my integration data? what is my config?
- Context: what integrations can I have? what containers can I have?

The output is another `State`: the state after
the charm has interacted with the mocked Juju model.
The output state is the same type of data structure as the input state.

Writing unit tests for a charm, then, means verifying that:

- the output state (as compared with the input state) is as expected
- the charm does not raise uncaught exceptions while handling the event

A test consists of three broad steps:

- **Arrange**:
    - declare the context
    - declare the input state
- **Act**:
    - run an event (ie. obtain the output state, given the input state and the event)
- **Assert**:
    - verify that the output state is what you expect it to be
    - verify that the charm has seen a certain sequence of statuses, events, and `juju-log` calls

.. note::
    Unit testing is only one aspect of a comprehensive testing strategy. For more
    on testing charms, see `Charm SDK | Testing <https://juju.is/docs/sdk/testing>`_.

   _The list here is manually maintained, because the `automodule` directive
   expects to document names defined in the module, and not imported ones, and
   we're doing the opposite of that - and we also want to use the 'ops.testing'
   namespace, not expose the 'ops._private.harness' and 'scenario' ones.
   Ideally, someone will figure out a nicer way to do this that doesn't require
   keeping this list in sync (see test/test_infra.py for a check that we are ok).
