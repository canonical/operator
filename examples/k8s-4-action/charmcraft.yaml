    # The upstream-source field is ignored by Charmcraft and Juju, but it can be
    # useful to developers in identifying the source of the OCI image.  It is also
    # used by the 'canonical/charming-actions' GitHub action for automated releases.
    # The test_deploy function in tests/integration/test_charm.py reads upstream-source
    # to determine which OCI image to use when running the charm's integration tests.
