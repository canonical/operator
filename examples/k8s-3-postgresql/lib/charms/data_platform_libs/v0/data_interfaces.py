r"""Library to manage the relation for the data-platform products.

This library contains the Requires and Provides classes for handling the relation
between an application and multiple managed application supported by the data-team:
MySQL, Postgresql, MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka.

### Database (MySQL, Postgresql, MongoDB, and Redis)

#### Requires Charm
This library is a uniform interface to a selection of common database
metadata, with added custom events that add convenience to database management,
and methods to consume the application related data.


Following an example of using the DatabaseCreatedEvent, in the context of the
application charm code:

```python

from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.data_interfaces import (
    DatabaseCreatedEvent,
    DatabaseRequires,
)

class ApplicationCharm(CharmBase):
    # Application charm that connects to database charms.

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)

        # Charm events defined in the database requires charm library.
        self.database = DatabaseRequires(self, relation_name="database", database_name="database")
        self.framework.observe(self.database.on.database_created, self._on_database_created)

    def _on_database_created(self, event: DatabaseCreatedEvent) -> None:
        # Handle the created database

        # Create configuration file for app
        config_file = self._render_app_config_file(
            event.username,
            event.password,
            event.endpoints,
        )

        # Start application with rendered configuration
        self._start_application(config_file)

        # Set active status
        self.unit.status = ActiveStatus("received database credentials")
```

As shown above, the library provides some custom events to handle specific situations,
which are listed below:

-  database_created: event emitted when the requested database is created.
-  endpoints_changed: event emitted when the read/write endpoints of the database have changed.
-  read_only_endpoints_changed: event emitted when the read-only endpoints of the database
  have changed. Event is not triggered if read/write endpoints changed too.

If it is needed to connect multiple database clusters to the same relation endpoint
the application charm can implement the same code as if it would connect to only
one database cluster (like the above code example).

To differentiate multiple clusters connected to the same relation endpoint
the application charm can use the name of the remote application:

```python

def _on_database_created(self, event: DatabaseCreatedEvent) -> None:
    # Get the remote app name of the cluster that triggered this event
    cluster = event.relation.app.name
```

It is also possible to provide an alias for each different database cluster/relation.

So, it is possible to differentiate the clusters in two ways.
The first is to use the remote application name, i.e., `event.relation.app.name`, as above.

The second way is to use different event handlers to handle each cluster events.
The implementation would be something like the following code:

```python

from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.data_interfaces import (
    DatabaseCreatedEvent,
    DatabaseRequires,
)

class ApplicationCharm(CharmBase):
    # Application charm that connects to database charms.

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)

        # Define the cluster aliases and one handler for each cluster database created event.
        self.database = DatabaseRequires(
            self,
            relation_name="database",
            database_name="database",
            relations_aliases = ["cluster1", "cluster2"],
        )
        self.framework.observe(
            self.database.on.cluster1_database_created, self._on_cluster1_database_created
        )
        self.framework.observe(
            self.database.on.cluster2_database_created, self._on_cluster2_database_created
        )

    def _on_cluster1_database_created(self, event: DatabaseCreatedEvent) -> None:
        # Handle the created database on the cluster named cluster1

        # Create configuration file for app
        config_file = self._render_app_config_file(
            event.username,
            event.password,
            event.endpoints,
        )
        ...

    def _on_cluster2_database_created(self, event: DatabaseCreatedEvent) -> None:
        # Handle the created database on the cluster named cluster2

        # Create configuration file for app
        config_file = self._render_app_config_file(
            event.username,
            event.password,
            event.endpoints,
        )
        ...

```

When it's needed to check whether a plugin (extension) is enabled on the PostgreSQL
charm, you can use the is_postgresql_plugin_enabled method. To use that, you need to
add the following dependency to your charmcraft.yaml file:

```yaml

parts:
  charm:
    charm-binary-python-packages:
      - psycopg[binary]

```

### Provider Charm

Following an example of using the DatabaseRequestedEvent, in the context of the
database charm code:

```python
from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.data_interfaces import DatabaseProvides

class SampleCharm(CharmBase):

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)
        # Charm events defined in the database provides charm library.
        self.provided_database = DatabaseProvides(self, relation_name="database")
        self.framework.observe(self.provided_database.on.database_requested,
            self._on_database_requested)
        # Database generic helper
        self.database = DatabaseHelper()

    def _on_database_requested(self, event: DatabaseRequestedEvent) -> None:
        # Handle the event triggered by a new database requested in the relation
        # Retrieve the database name using the charm library.
        db_name = event.database
        # generate a new user credential
        username = self.database.generate_user()
        password = self.database.generate_password()
        # set the credentials for the relation
        self.provided_database.set_credentials(event.relation.id, username, password)
        # set other variables for the relation event.set_tls("False")
```
As shown above, the library provides a custom event (database_requested) to handle
the situation when an application charm requests a new database to be created.
It's preferred to subscribe to this event instead of relation changed event to avoid
creating a new database when other information other than a database name is
exchanged in the relation databag.

### Kafka

This library is the interface to use and interact with the Kafka charm. This library contains
custom events that add convenience to manage Kafka, and provides methods to consume the
application related data.

#### Requirer Charm

```python

from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.data_interfaces import (
    BootstrapServerChangedEvent,
    KafkaRequires,
    TopicCreatedEvent,
)

class ApplicationCharm(CharmBase):

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)
        self.kafka = KafkaRequires(self, "kafka_client", "test-topic")
        self.framework.observe(
            self.kafka.on.bootstrap_server_changed, self._on_kafka_bootstrap_server_changed
        )
        self.framework.observe(
            self.kafka.on.topic_created, self._on_kafka_topic_created
        )

    def _on_kafka_bootstrap_server_changed(self, event: BootstrapServerChangedEvent):
        # Event triggered when a bootstrap server was changed for this application

        new_bootstrap_server = event.bootstrap_server
        ...

    def _on_kafka_topic_created(self, event: TopicCreatedEvent):
        # Event triggered when a topic was created for this application
        username = event.username
        password = event.password
        tls = event.tls
        tls_ca= event.tls_ca
        bootstrap_server event.bootstrap_server
        consumer_group_prefic = event.consumer_group_prefix
        zookeeper_uris = event.zookeeper_uris
        ...

```

As shown above, the library provides some custom events to handle specific situations,
which are listed below:

- topic_created: event emitted when the requested topic is created.
- bootstrap_server_changed: event emitted when the bootstrap server have changed.
- credential_changed: event emitted when the credentials of Kafka changed.

### Provider Charm

Following the previous example, this is an example of the provider charm.

```python
class SampleCharm(CharmBase):

from charms.data_platform_libs.v0.data_interfaces import (
    KafkaProvides,
    TopicRequestedEvent,
)

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)

        # Default charm events.
        self.framework.observe(self.on.start, self._on_start)

        # Charm events defined in the Kafka Provides charm library.
        self.kafka_provider = KafkaProvides(self, relation_name="kafka_client")
        self.framework.observe(self.kafka_provider.on.topic_requested, self._on_topic_requested)
        # Kafka generic helper
        self.kafka = KafkaHelper()

    def _on_topic_requested(self, event: TopicRequestedEvent):
        # Handle the on_topic_requested event.

        topic = event.topic
        relation_id = event.relation.id
        # set connection info in the databag relation
        self.kafka_provider.set_bootstrap_server(relation_id, self.kafka.get_bootstrap_server())
        self.kafka_provider.set_credentials(relation_id, username=username, password=password)
        self.kafka_provider.set_consumer_group_prefix(relation_id, ...)
        self.kafka_provider.set_tls(relation_id, "False")
        self.kafka_provider.set_zookeeper_uris(relation_id, ...)

```
As shown above, the library provides a custom event (topic_requested) to handle
the situation when an application charm requests a new topic to be created.
It is preferred to subscribe to this event instead of relation changed event to avoid
creating a new topic when other information other than a topic name is
exchanged in the relation databag.
